\section{Conclusion and Outlook} \label{sec:conclusion}

We have demonstrated the feasibility of realizing MANE for
scalable video streaming using P4 programming language. Through the high
programmability offered by software-defined networks, we show how optimally
dropping scalable video packets improves the streaming quality, while many
other optimization approaches are possible in the future. For example, 
video and non-video
Internet services can be managed in a Quality-of-Service fair way, and popular
video packets can be proactively or reactively cached.
