\section{Plan} \label{sec:Plan}

To approach our goal, we have learned how to write P4 programming language and setup our testbed inside Mininet. The next step is to finish our three drop logics, tail, EL, and RDO in our P4-based MANEs. Then we will run some experiments to make sure we optimally drop the packets. To leverage the advantage of SDN, we connect the P4-based MANEs with the ONOS controller. Next we will set up an server or write a program for developers to command our P4-based MANE in runtime, and we also need to make the controller able to reroute the flows if there's a physical disconnection.
